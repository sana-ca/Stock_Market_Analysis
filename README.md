# Stock_Market_Analysis

# 📊 Stock Market Analysis (Pre-LSTM Phase)

This project performs exploratory analysis and preprocessing of historical stock market data as a foundation for future deep learning models such as LSTM. The code is implemented in Python using Google Colab.

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Analyze and prepare time-series stock data for modeling.
- **Dataset**: Historical prices for tech stocks and cryptocurrencies (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin), sourced from Kaggle.
- **Scope**: 
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering (technical indicators)
  - Data normalization
  - Sequence creation for supervised learning

❌ **Note**: This version does *not* include training or prediction using LSTM models.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Visualizations of price trends and returns
- Correlation analysis of features
- Calculation of indicators such as:
  - Moving Averages
  - On-Balance Volume (OBV)
  - MACD
  - Garman-Klass volatility
- Preparation of data sequences (past n days) for future model input

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
